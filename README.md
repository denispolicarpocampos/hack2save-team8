### Requirements:
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/apps)

### Clone the repository
First, clone the repository:
`$ git clone https://github.com/iujisato/webco2-backup.git`

then `cd` into `hack2save-team8`
`$ cd hack2save-team8`

### Set Rails configs
Set the sample configs for rails:
`$ cp .env.sample .env`
`$ cp config/database-sample.yml config/database.yml`

### Set docker container
Pull and build `docker` containers for project:
`$ docker-compose build`
`$ docker-compose run web rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`

### Set Facebook keys
Ask for permission on facebook dev app. After granting access, open the `.env`
file inside your favorite editor and set Facebook_APP_ID and Facebook_Secret_ID.

### Start Docker container
Then start the container:
`$ docker-compose up`

Then navigate with your browser to `localhost:3000`, login with
```
username: john.doe@mail.com
password: '123456'
```
and have some fun!

To enter the container environment:
`$ docker-compose run web bash`

Remember that all the files created inside the container will belong to root.

### FAQ
Some files generated by Rails inside container may require changing permission
access to edit. This can be bypassed with:
```
// Please use the command below with CAUTION, since it will change the ownership
of everything inside your current folder RECURSIVELY.

$ sudo chown -R <your_username> .
```
